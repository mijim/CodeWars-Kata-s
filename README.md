# CodeWars-Kata-s
Solutions to the challanges perfomed on CodeWars

## Averages of numbers (challange 6):

Write a method, that gets an array of integer-numbers and return an array of the averages of each integer-number and his follower, if there is one.

Example:

Input:  [ 1, 3, 5, 1, -10]
Output:  [ 2, 4, 3, -4.5]
If the array has 0 or 1 values or is null or None, your method should return an empty array.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

## Deodorant Evaporator (challange 5):

This program tests the life of an evaporator containing a gas.

We know the content of the evaporator (content in ml), the percentage of foam or gas lost every day (evap_per_day) and the threshold (threshold) in percentage beyond which the evaporator is no longer useful. All numbers are strictly positive.

The program reports the nth day (as an integer) on which the evaporator will be out of use.

Note : Content is in fact not necessary in the body of the function "evaporator", you can use it or not use it, as you wish. Some people might prefer to reason with content, some other with percentages only. It's up to you but you must keep it as a parameter because the tests have it as an argument.

## Length of missing array (challange 4):

You get an array of arrays.
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.
But one array is missing!


You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.

Example:
[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3


If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.

When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.

I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.

## Regex validate PIN code (challange 3):

ATM machines allow 4 or 6 digit PIN codes and PIN codes cannot contain anything but exactly 4 digits or exactly 6 digits.

If the function is passed a valid PIN string, return true, else return false.

eg:

validatePIN("1234") === true
validatePIN("12345") === false
validatePIN("a234") === false

## Find the odd int (challange 2):

Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

## Complementary DNA (challange 1):

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

dnaStrand("ATTGC") # return "TAACG"

dnaStrand("GTAT") # return "CATA"
